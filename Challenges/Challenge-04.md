[Previous Challenge >](Challenge-03.md) - [Home](../README.md) 

## Introduction

In this mission, you will be tasked with ensuring the resilience and stability of our space station amidst the unpredictable and chaotic cosmic storms.
As you embark on this mission, remember that the key to success lies in your ability to quickly identify and correct any deviations from your defined infrastructure state. Terraform is your shield and sword, empowering you to restore order amidst the chaos of the cosmic storm.

## Description

- During this mission, a simulated cosmic storm will strike, orchestrated by the mission facilitators. This storm will randomly disrupt and delete various resources within your infrastructure.
- Your task is to use Terraform to detect and remediate these configuration drifts, swiftly restoring your space station to its optimal state.

## Success Criteria

- You were able to identify the configuration drift against your infrastructure
- The configuration drift has been remediated and terraform does not show difference anymore.
