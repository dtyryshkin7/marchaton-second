# Marchaton #2 - The Deployment Odyssey

## Introduction

The second episode of Codetober will introduce participants to the fundamental concepts of Terraform, an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, while provisioning and managing cloud resources on Microsoft Azure. Participants will learn how to use Terraform to create and manage resource groups, virtual networks, and virtual machines. The workshop will culminate in a practical challenge where participants will experience the resilience and efficiency of Terraform in recovering from unexpected resource deletions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Understand the Fundamentals of Terraform: core concepts including providers, resources and state files
- Provision resources with Terraform: define and deploy resource groups, virtual networks, and virtual machines.
- Simulate the accidental deletion of resources and understand the impact on the infrastructure while using Teraform to detect and recover deleted resources efficiently, ensuring minimal downtime.
- Learn how Terraform integrates with change management processes to ensure controlled and documented infrastructure changes.
